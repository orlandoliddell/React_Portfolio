            One thing that most people don't get to see, is my entire name: Orlando Malik Ramon Liddell-Warfield.
            Before you ask, yes, I had to bubble my whole name during standardized tests.
            I was born and raised in the Carlinas, which is also where I met my wonderful wife Lea Knox Liddell. We
            are a happy family with 2 girls, a boy, 2 dogs, and 2 cats.

            Before I was blessed with a Covid layoff, I was driving a forklift for about 4 years. Once I had the
            oppurtunity, I decided to continue my education and change my family's life. I pray for a day where I
            can focus more on my family's future and less on tedious things like bills.
